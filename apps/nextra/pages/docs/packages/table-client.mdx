# @leight/table-client

Here you can find a way how to work with UI tables build on top of [Mantine Table](https://mantine.dev/core/table/) and [`Source`](../concepts/source).

## Installation

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
    <Tab>
        ```bash copy filename="npm"
        npm i @leight/table-client
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash copy filename="pnpm"
        pnpm i @leight/table-client
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash copy filename="yarn"
        yarn add @leight/table-client
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Usage

Wraps [Mantine Table](https://mantine.dev/core/table/) with quite simpler usage, connects to [`Source`](../concepts/source) and also supports [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) by default.

### Table

Common `Table` is a dummy thing without any data bindings with improved typings and usage, then the pure one from Mantine.

<Table
    withTranslation={{
        namespace: 'foo',
    }}
    columns={{
        id: {
            render: 'id',
        },
        foo: {
            width:'120',
            render: ({foo}) => {
                return <>extended {foo}</>
            },
        },
        nunu: {
            width: 10,
            render: 'nunu',
        },
    }}
    items={[
        {id: '1', foo: 'foo1', nunu: 1},
        {id: '2', foo: 'foo2', nunu: 2},
    ]}
/>

### SourceTable

<Callout>
    If you want to understand, how this stuff works, you should read more about [`Source`](../concepts/source)s.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    This component is based on the `Table` above, so it shares a lot of common properties.
</Callout>

`SourceTable` is quite clever thing which requires a lot of other stuff to make it work, but it's worth it.
