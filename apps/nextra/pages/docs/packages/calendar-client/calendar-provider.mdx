# CalendarProvider

This component holds state for a [Calendar](./calendar) component. Each calendar should have it's own Store until you want to
share same state between multiple calendars.

If you need to work with calendar data or generate your own calendar stuff (headless), you can you this provider as it wraps
Years, Months and Weeks for displaying all kind of calendars (like in [this example](./calendar#advanced-usage)).
