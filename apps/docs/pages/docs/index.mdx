# Welcome

So, here you're. You've found very interesting project, which is intended to help develop fullstack web applications with the help of Next.js, React, Mantine UI and
zilions of other libraries.

It's a quite specific project, so you have to start with it's concepts, just to check, if we can be friends.

## Requirements

You should be familiar with fullstack web development, in this case be familiar with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/),
[React](https://react.dev/) and a lot of others stuff. If you don't know some used libraries, they have great docs too, so read it, it's not that hard :).

Also, you have to be curious and open minded, because if you're kind of `oldschool` guy, leave, your health is in danger.

## Batteries included

Did you expect to have `Getting started` as the very first item in the menu? **Nope**.

Why? Because you should understand, what this collection of
libraries does, because it's all connected via concepts which you should see first.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    So please, continue to `Concepts` to check, if your mindset will be able to accept a library which is not done in that traditional way.
