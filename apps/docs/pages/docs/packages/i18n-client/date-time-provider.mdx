# DateTimeProvider

<Callout>
    If you're using [PageShell](../mantine/page-shell) or [Shell](../mantine/shell) from [@leight/mantine](../mantine), this provider is already included.

This is the base component for any `date & time` related operations. For example, if you want to use [Calendar](../calendar-client/calendar), you must use this component.
