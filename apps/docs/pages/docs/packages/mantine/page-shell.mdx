export function MyApp(
    {
        Component,
        pageProps,
    }: AppProps) {
    /**
     * Just use PageShell and fill all required props; if you want to add your own
     * services, just put them as child as you're used to.
     */
    return <PageShell
        title={"my-app"}
        emotionCache={emotionCache}
        Component={Component}
        pageProps={pageProps}
    />;

/**
 * This is a bit unrelated, but to keep example complete, this provides connection of your app to tRPC.
