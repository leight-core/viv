# Introduction

<Callout>
    _**Bobobo**_ at the beginning! You may _skip_ this section, but you'll loose **deep insights** into the libraries and what's behind the scenes.

    It's strongly **recommended** _(by some unknown wizard)_ to at least **fly** through those pages (_hey, I've put a lot of time to write this, you know..._) and get
    used to the concepts here. They can help you _**at least steal**_ some of my ideas (which I've probably stolen somewhere else) and **boost** your own project even
    _**without using**_ any of this work.

This library has a lot of concepts which work well together, but may looks sometimes _quite complicated_. But everything done is **well thought** and polished.
Believe me, it was _a lot of time and effort I've put into development of this thing_.

So - you're free to look around and see, **why** all the things are done in such ways and what put me into doing things by that.

## What's inside

You'll find this library wants you to use Monorepo. It's cool tool for managing codebase, even for a smaller app. _There is some pain, but it's acceptable, believe me :)_

There are a lot of snippets which will help you to setup or integrate this library into your project. Basic assumption is you have `Node` backend, because full power of this
library is in covering fullstack TypeScript on both sides.

The main target is the development of the application, so it's not suitable for static sites or just sites. But if you want some home-made app for something (pet project), or even
setup some bigger app, you can use this as it can help a lot. This project is highly optimized for **small teams** of one member which do not have a lot of time to mess
with all the libraries around.
