Here you can find all the packages broken into really tiny pieces to keep the stuff separated. In general it could be
treated as kind of
meta-framework which enhances a lot of other libraries to keep full-stack development much easier. Even just some pieces
you
can use in whatever way you want (for example, IQuery to shape queries into a repository).
