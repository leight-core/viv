# Leight Viv

## Welcome

This project is a collection of [fullstack libraries](docs/packages) and concepts which should drastically simplify development of quite any
application.

Everything done in this project is highly opinionated, but also quite versatile, so one could alter basically anything.

One of the base concepts this project uses is `MCP` [see more in docs](docs/concepts/mcp) which can simplify a lot of stuff in basically any project.

## Motivation

All the time new app is created, there is a lot of stuff shared between them a lot of same concepts, data fetching, mutations and so on. This collection
aims to make kind of "standard" which offloads thinking of "how to get data", "how to sort data", creating tables, forms, connecting them to the backend
and a lot of other stuff.

So here we're: you can pick [some tools](docs/packages), you can use a [whole collection](docs/workbench) and simplify your developer life a lot by generating pieces of repeated code,
having everything typed and so on.

## Used technologies

### Prisma

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is the ultimate database tool providing typings for database model. Leight implements some tools which separate and simplifies usage of prisma.

With `MCP` in mind, everything has [Zod schema](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod) generated by the great tool of [this guy](https://github.com/chrishoermann): [zod-prisma-types](https://github.com/chrishoermann/zod-prisma-types).

## Mature status

You see this as yet another project. You're right.

It's used in some internal apps and also it has quite some time behind, it's nothing new - whole library has been rewritten multiple times, ages a few years
and today is mature enough to handle a lot of your needs, just see some [workbench recipes](docs/workbench) if there is something interesting for you.
