You can setup the project in whatever way you want, but here are some advices which could help a bit.

## concurrently

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
    <Tab>
        ```bash copy filename="npm"
        npm i -D concurrently
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash copy filename="pnpm"
        pnpm i -D concurrently
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash copy filename="yarn"
        yarn add -D concurrently
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

This library is quite useful, because it enables you execute multiple sections of your scripts in parallel. You may think
it would not be required everywhere, but it's `-D` dependency, so who cares.

Than you can have something like this

```json filename="package.json"
{
    "scripts": {
        "build": "concurrently npm:build:*",
        "build:esbuild": "node esbuild.mjs",
        "build:types": "tsc --outDir lib"
    }
}
```

## del-cli

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
    <Tab>
        ```bash copy filename="npm"
        npm i -D del-cli
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash copy filename="pnpm"
        pnpm i -D del-cli
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash copy filename="yarn"
        yarn add -D del-cli
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

Nice tool for deleting files, useful if you want to cleanup mess generated by all those build tools.

<Callout>
    **Be careful here**, because this command deletes also JavaScript files in the src folder, so if you blindly copy and execute this, don't blame me.

    It's useful when your `TSC` emits files **into** your source code, so you want to cleanup the mess.
</Callout>

```json filename="package.json"
{
    "scripts": {
        "cleanup": "del-cli .turbo lib tsconfig.tsbuildinfo src/**/*.{d.ts,d.ts.map,js,js.map}"
    }
}
```

## dotenv

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
    <Tab>
        ```bash copy filename="npm"
        npm i -D dotenv-cli
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash copy filename="pnpm"
        pnpm i -D dotenv-cli
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash copy filename="yarn"
        yarn add -D dotenv-cli
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

Nice tool for forwarding env variables and reads `.env` files. Quite cool thing.

<Callout>
    Do you see this? So **don't do that!** If there is `.env.development` file, it would get loaded and you'll f*ck up your production build.
</Callout>

```json filename="package.json"
{
    "scripts": {
        "build": "dotenv -c development -- next build"
    }
}
```
