# Zustand

This is a very [cool package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zustand) for state management and creating stores. You can create shape of store outside
React components and then nicely use it where you want.

By default, Zustand stores are global, so when you create some `useBearStore(){:js}`, it represents global state. Because `@leight` needs a lot of local
contexts (for example [Source](../concepts/source/client#context)) for managing data for component subtrees, there was need for some little wrapper around
Zustand store.

**Motivation** for creating this library was boilerplate around defining store, creating Context Providers, creating hooks and having everything typed. So here
comes this library - there is _one simple method_, which handles all the **boilerplate** for you.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    [`@leight/context-client`](../packages/context-client) re-exports everything from [`@leight/zustand`](../packages/zustand) for simplicity.
</Callout>

## Installation

We're talking about Zustand, but all the magick is implemented in [@leight/context-client](../packages/context-client) package which handles React Context, also
wrapping Zustand into the Context, so you can use Stores in component subtree.

        ```bash copy filename="yarn"

    </Tab>
</Tabs>

This package provides a lot of tools for [React Context](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext) and for creating Zustand stores, see [package page](../packages/context-client) for more info.

## Usage

There are three stages: you define a shape of store and create all the required tools, provide values to component subtree and subscribe to value changes.

### Store

This is an example taken from [@leight/utils-client](../packages/utils-client).

```ts filename="LoopContext.ts"
import {createStoreContext, type IStoreProps} from "@leight/context-client";

/**
 * Define and export store props as a type; type IStoreProps is re-exported from `@leight/zustand`.
 *
 * This is common store stuff same as for Zustand itself; if you want wrap your existing store, just use
 * IStoreProps. If you want to leave this library, remove it.
 */
export type ILoopStoreProps = IStoreProps<{
    readonly isRunning: boolean;
    readonly isDone: boolean;
    readonly isError: boolean;
    readonly isSuccess?: boolean;
    readonly current: number;
    readonly total: number;

    progress(): void;

    start(total: number): void;

    finish(withError?: boolean): void;

    error(error?: boolean): void;

    percent(): number;
}>

/**
 * Here is where all the magick comes from:  `createStoreContext`; this method creates all boilerplate stuff you would eventually
 * write yourself....
 */
export const {
                /**
                 * ...you get StoreProvider, so you can wrap component subtree with this Store
                 */
                 Provider:         LoopProvider,
                 /**
                  * ...you get hook for accessing store state within component subtree
                  *
                  * - this method throws an error if there is no provider
                  */
                 useState:         useLoopState,
                 /**
                  * ...this is an optional variant for the store - this method does not throw an error
                  */
                 useOptionalState: useOptionalLoopState,
                 /**
                  * ...you get access to store itself, if you need it
                  */
                 useStore:         useLoopStore,
                 /**
                  * ...and optional variant of store access
                  */
                 useOptionalStore: useOptionalLoopStore,
             } = createStoreContext<ILoopStoreProps>({
    /**
     * This is a little magic, but state is a callback which gets `default` and `state` from the ContextProvider when it's used. Remember those two values.
     *
     * You can access defaults (which is whole store type data (in this case `ILoopStoreProps`) or just required state (about it later).
     *
     * The last part of callback is a standard Zustand store creator.
     */
    state: ({defaults, state}) => (set, get) => ({
        total:     0,
        isRunning: false,
        isDone:    false,
        isError:   false,
        isSuccess: false,
        current:   0,
        progress:  () => set(({current}) => ({current: current + 1})),
        start:     (total) => set({isRunning: true, total}),
        finish:    (withError = false) =>
                       set({
                           isDone:    true,
                           isRunning: false,
                           isError:   withError,
                           isSuccess: !withError,
                       }),
        error:     (isError = true) => set({isError, isSuccess: !isError}),
        percent:   () => {
            const {current, total} = get();
            return (100 * current) / total;
        },
    }),
    /**
     * When context needs to throw an error, this names it, so you know who was the bad boy.
     */
    name:  "LoopContext",
    hint:  "Add LoopProvider."
});
```

### Provider

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Code, methods and interfaces inside `@leight` are mostly commented, so when you pick piece of code, read comments on properties to learn
    more.
</Callout>

This is the hardest part.

```tsx
/** here will be import from your package */
import {LoopProvider} from "@leight/utils-client";

export const MyComponent = () => {
	return <LoopProvider
        /**
         * Did you remember those two values?
         *
         * state: this resolved problem with Zustand where you must provide all values in the time of store creation, even those
         * you eventually don't have; this allows you to provide it here; `state` are required values a store cannot work without.
         */
        state={}
        /**
         * Just defaults; you can freely override whatever you want; but state muse be provided, if there are any required values.
         */
        defaults={}
    >
        here I've available useLoop stuff and so on.
    </LoopProvider>;
};
```

### Consumer

```tsx
/** here will be import from your package */
import {LoopProvider, useLoopState} from "@leight/utils-client";

export const MyConsumer = () => {
	/**
     * When you want to use the store, it's the same as with native Zustand
     *
     * ...you can take the whole store (so also remember, the component will re-render
     * when anything changes in the store).
     */
	// const store = useLoopState();
    /**
     * ...or you can use selectors, so the component will re-render only when selected
     * values changes. Everything is cleverly typed,
     * so don't worry, you won't lose any types.
     */
	const {isRunning} = useLoopState(({isRunning}) => ({isRunning}));
	return isRunning ? <span>Gogogogogo!</span> : <span>I'm lazy today!</span>;
};

export const MyComponent = () => {
	return <LoopProvider>
        <MyConsumer/>
    </LoopProvider>;
};
```

## Advanced example

`@leight` solves one interesting "problem" of Zustand: when you are creating new store, you have to provide all the store props; there are situations
when you need provide store props when a `Provider` is created.

So this library implements an ability to specify store props needed when a store is created and values which could be provided in `runtime`.

Partial example from [`@leight/calendar-client`](../packages/calendar-client) where this approach is used.

```tsx filename="CalendarProvider.tsx"
import {
    createStoreContext,
    type IStoreProps
} from "@leight/context-client";
import {
    type ICalendarProps,
    type IUseCalendarOptions,
    useCalendar
} from "@tuplo/use-calendar";
import {
    type ComponentProps,
    type FC
} from "react";

/**
 * Defined store as you're used to, but...
 */
export type ICalendarStoreStoreProps = IStoreProps<{
	/**
     * Here are properties and methods required to run the store; here you have usually
     * all store methods.
     */
    foo: string;
}, {
	/**
     * Here the magic comes: those properties are required in `runtime`, so when `CalendarStoreProvider`
     * is created.
     */
    calendar: ICalendarProps;
}>

export const {
                 Provider:         CalendarStoreProvider,
                 useState:         useCalendarStoreState,
                 useOptionalState: useOptionalCalendarStoreState,
                 useStore:         useCalendarStoreStore,
                 useOptionalStore: useOptionalCalendarStoreStore,
             } = createStoreContext<ICalendarStoreStoreProps>({
    state: ({state}) => () => ({
        /**
         * Here you can see: you *must* provide required store props, thus you need to know default
         * values here.
         */
        foo: "yep",
        /**
         * `calendar` props is also required, but it's required before, so you can be sure the whole store
         * is ready here.
         */
        ...state,
    }),
    name:  "CalendarStoreContext",
    hint:  "Add CalendarStoreProvider.",
});

export interface ICalendarProviderProps extends Omit<ComponentProps<typeof CalendarStoreProvider>, "state"> {
    options?: Partial<IUseCalendarOptions>;
}

export const CalendarProvider: FC<ICalendarProviderProps> = ({options, ...props}) => {
	/**
     * Get your value from whatever source you need...
     */
	const calendar = useCalendar(options);
    return <CalendarStoreProvider
        /**
         * Because you specified values of store, "state" prop is unlocked and required, so TypeScript
         * tells you, whats needed here.
         */
        state={{
			/**
             * Tadaa! "calendar" props is required as you specified before, so you provide rest of
             * store values here.
             */
            calendar,
        }}
        {...props}
    />;
};
```
