# Zustand

This is a very [cool package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zustand) for state management and creating stores. You can create shape of store outside
React components and then nicely use it where you want.

By default, Zustand stores are global, so when you create some `useBearStore(){:js}`, it represents global state. Because `@leight` needs a lot of local
contexts (for example [Source](../concepts/source/client#context)) for managing data for component subtrees, there was need for some little wrapper around
Zustand store.

**Motivation** for creating this library was boilerplate around defining store, creating Context Providers, creating hooks and having everything typed. So here
comes this library - there is _one simple method_, which handles all the **boilerplate** for you.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    [`@leight/context-client`](../packages/context-client) re-exports everything from [`@leight/zustand`](../packages/zustand) for simplicity.
</Callout>

## Installation

We're talking about Zustand, but all the magick is implemented in [@leight/context-client](../packages/context-client) package which handles React Context, also
wrapping Zustand into the Context, so you can use Stores in component subtree.

        ```bash copy filename="npm"
        npm i @leight/context-client
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash copy filename="pnpm"
        pnpm i @leight/context-client
        ```

        ```bash copy filename="yarn"
        yarn add @leight/context-client
        ```

This package provides a lot of tools for [React Context](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext) and for creating Zustand stores, see [package page](../packages/context-client) for more info.

## Usage

### Create

This is an example taken from [@leight/utils-client](../packages/utils-client).

```ts filename="LoopContext.ts"
import {createStoreContext, type IStoreProps} from "@leight/context-client";

/**
 * Define and export store props as a type; type IStoreProps is re-exported from `@leight/zustand`.
 *
 * This is common store stuff same as for Zustand itself; if you want wrap your existing store, just use
 * IStoreProps. If you want to leave this library, remove it.
 */
export type ILoopStoreProps = IStoreProps<{
    readonly isRunning: boolean;
    readonly isDone: boolean;
    readonly isError: boolean;
    readonly isSuccess?: boolean;
    readonly current: number;
    readonly total: number;

    progress(): void;

    start(total: number): void;

    finish(withError?: boolean): void;

    error(error?: boolean): void;

    percent(): number;
}>

 * Here is where all the magick comes from:  `createStoreContext`; this method creates all boilerplate stuff you would eventually
 * write yourself....

### Provide

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Code, methods and interfaces inside `@leight` are mostly commented, so when you pick piece of code, read comments on properties to learn
    more.
</Callout>

This is the hardest part.

```tsx
/** here will be import from your package */
import {LoopProvider} from "@leight/utils-client";

export const MyComponent = () => {
	return <LoopProvider
        /**
         * Did you remember those two values?
         *
         * state: this resolved problem with Zustand where you must provide all values in the time of store creation, even those
         * you eventually don't have; this allows you to provide it here; `state` are required values a store cannot work without.
         */
        state={}
        /**
         * Just defaults; you can freely override whatever you want; but state muse be provided, if there are any required values.
         */
        defaults={}
    >
        here I've available useLoop stuff and so on.
    </LoopProvider>;
};
```

### Consume

```tsx
/** here will be import from your package */
import {LoopProvider, useLoopState} from "@leight/utils-client";

export const MyConsumer = () => {
	/**
     * When you want to use the store, it's the same as with native Zustand
     *
     * ...you can take the whole store (so also remember, the component will re-render
     * when anything changes in the store).
     */
	// const store = useLoopState();
    /**
     * ...or you can use selectors, so the component will re-render only when selected
     * values changes. Everything is cleverly typed,
     * so don't worry, you won't lose any types.
     */
	const {isRunning} = useLoopState(({isRunning}) => ({isRunning}));
	return isRunning ? <span>Gogogogogo!</span> : <span>I'm lazy today!</span>;
};

export const MyComponent = () => {
	return <LoopProvider>
        <MyConsumer/>
    </LoopProvider>;
};
```
