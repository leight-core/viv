# SDK

## Prologue

SDK stands as an implementation of `MCP` in the `@leight` collection. It's meant as development kit, which you should **not** modify as it comes `from outside`, in this case from generator.

## Installation

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
    <Tab>
        ```bash copy filename="npm"
        npm i -D @leight/sdk tsx concurrently typescript
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash copy filename="pnpm"
        pnpm i -D @leight/sdk tsx concurrently typescript
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash copy filename="yarn"
        yarn add -D @leight/sdk tsx concurrently typescript
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

- **@leight/sdk**: The generator itself
- **tsx**: Generator does not ship executable as it expects being executed by the user (that's you!); with this in mind, you can use whatever executor you want
- **typescript**: You already should have one for obvious reasons
- **concurrently**: This one is also required by a concept and setup of [package.json](../concepts/package.json)

## Usage

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    If you want to use this part of the library, you should be familiar with [Source](../concepts/source) concept.
</Callout>

<Callout>
    If you want to use this, you're already using [monorepo](/docs/concepts/monorepo), but this guide also **requires** usage of standalone [prisma package](./prisma) for your app (or lib).
</Callout>

Update `package.json` (applies for all three kind of packages - [client/server/common](/docs/concepts/code-splitting)).

```json copy
{
    "scripts": {
        "generate": "concurrently npm:generate:*",
        "generate:sdk": "tsx src/leight-sdk.ts"
    }
}
```

Add generator scripts to your `package.json`; `concurrently` is present, because some of your packages may use more generators (for example prisma), so you're already prepared. But this is up to you, you're
_**the boss**_.

Now it's time for `leight-sdk.ts` configuration file: it's presence in `src` folder is just to keep everything together, and also it could get type-checked, so if something in generator API is changed, it could
help you find cause instead of strange death.

### Common

For your [API package](/docs/concepts/code-splitting#the-others) (without suffix) create a file `src/leight-sdk.ts`; you can choose whatever name you want, but _do not forget to update `package.json`_.

```ts filename="src/leight-sdk.ts" copy
import {withSdk, withSourceGenerators} from "@leight/sdk";

/**
 * Generator itself (handles file creation, execution, console params stuff and others...)
 */
void withSdk(
	/**
     * Common (api) set of generators; at the end it uses usually more internal generators, which could
     * also be used manually if you want/need.
     */
	withSourceGenerators({
        entity:   "Prisma entity name, for example User (case is important); this is used to generate Schemas",
        packages: {
            /**
             * Because you have a standalone prisma package, you can use it here, so generator can properly
             * import all Prisma parts of the model you want to generate.
             */
            prisma: "@my-app/prisma",
        },
        /**
         * You may optionally specify field names which should be generated in your SortSchema for the given
         * model. Remember that input (Sort) schema is not the same as OrderBy in Prisma, you have to handle
         * it in Source (to prevent direct internals exposure to the client).
         */
        sorts:    [
            "field-name",
            "field-name2",
            "field-name3",
        ],
    })
);
```

### Client

For your [client-side package](/docs/concepts/code-splitting#client) create a file `src/leight-sdk.ts`; you can choose whatever name you want, but _do not forget to update `package.json`_.

```ts filename="src/leight-sdk.ts" copy
import {withClientSourceGenerators, withSdk} from "@leight/sdk";

/**
 * Generator itself (handles file creation, execution, console params stuff and others...)
 */
void withSdk(
	/**
     * Client set of generators; at the end, it uses more internal generators, which could
     * also be used manually if you want/need.
     */
	withClientSourceGenerators({
        entity:   "Prisma entity name, for example User (case is important); this is used to generate Schemas",
        packages: {
            /**
             * This is a reference to a common package with generated schemas, interfaces and other
             * stuff required. Usually, current package name without suffix.
             */
            schema: "@my-app/model-name",
        },
        trpc:     {
            path:    "trpc.route.path",
            package: "@my-app/trpc-client",
        },
    })
);
```

### Server

For your [server-side package](/docs/concepts/code-splitting#server) create a file `src/leight-sdk.ts`; you can choose whatever name you want, but _do not forget to update `package.json`_.

```ts filename="src/leight-sdk.ts" copy
import {withServerSourceGenerators, withSdk} from "@leight/sdk";

/**
 * Generator itself (handles file creation, execution, console params stuff and others...)
 */
void withSdk(
	/**
     * Server set of generators; at the end, it uses more internal generators, which could
     * also be used manually if you want/need.
     */
	withServerSourceGenerators({
        entity:   "Prisma entity name, for example User (case is important); this is used to generate Schemas",
        packages: {
            /**
             * This is a reference to a common package with generated schemas, interfaces and other
             * stuff required. Usually, current package name without suffix.
             */
            schema: "@my-app/model-name",
            /**
             * Because you have a standalone prisma package, you can use it here, so generator can properly
             * import all Prisma parts of the model you want to generate.
             */
            prisma: "@my-app/prisma",
        },
        /**
         * This is a single name of the property on prismaClient which will be generated into the Source.
         */
        prisma:   "prismaClient.<entityName>",
    })
);
```

## Epilogue

Now you're almost done: just update your `turbo.json` (or whatever monorepo you're using):

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    **Don't copy-paste** this piece of code, just think about it's _meaning_: execute code generation **before** your build, so you're sure
    everything is in the place.
</Callout>

```json filename="turbo.json"
{
    "generate": {
        "cache": false
    },
    "build": {
        "dependsOn": [
            "^build",
            "generate"
        ]
    }
}
```
