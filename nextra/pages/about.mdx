# About

## edde.js

Very first project I've done as a javascript library which solved "React" for JavaScript 1.2 (embedded browsers for printers). It was quite
an interesting library, a lot of nice ideas, but _**world has moved a lot by the time**_.

But this was the start of the whole history of Leight Project.

## Project: Leight Core

Originally there was just a little piece built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [antd](https://ant.design/) with a few other tools.

It did a great job, worked well, but API of the library wasn't good. There were a lot of flaws, so the work continued and Leight Viv was born.

## Project: Leight Viv

Leight Core rewritten, rethink with a lot of new ideas. This is now ultimate way how you can handle frontend development with default support for
monorepos, code generation and a lot of other things you can commonly use, but simplified.

The main goal is to pick almost anything you repeatedly use and simplify it. So here we are!

__Viv__ is used because when I was expecting a child, a sex was unknown. Boy was _Tobias_ and girl _Vivienne_. I've started to use _Viv_ before... IT WAS A BOY, shit.
I like him, but the name remains.

## The name

Just a note: _why Leight_?

The shortcut was **L8**, you see that, but I don't like number usage in names, it's strange, thus Leight.

As development of library growth, it was used in live sports application, so the name came from Live _something something_ I forgot now. It sounds interesting. _That's it_.

## Team

Are you curious, how stable the project is? _It isn't._ Do you want to hear something else? I can lie, but as a lot of other libraries you probably rely on (same
as this project), there is usually one or a few guys working on the library in the spare time.

This project is done in cooperation with primary projects which uses it (corporate applications). But still, I'm, creating it in my spare time, with _no
commercial support_ and nothing else. You **do not** pay for it, so you should expect nothing but my pure ideas for free.

I'm _Marek H._ from Czechia. You're welcome to use anything, fork anything, write issues, extend this docs, ask questions, I'll be happy for that.

_**This project is my legacy**_, so there is quite a low probability I'll abandon it.
